# X99 EFI

**DO NOT COPY THIS DIRECTLY, ONLY USE FOR COMPARISON**

This config is used on an X99 system with an OOB supported GPU and NIC and is made for OpenCore 0.8.7. I made this config by following [the Haswell-E install guide by dortania](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-HEDT/haswell-e.html). You should do the same.

## Some of things to look out for
- Disable VT-d in BIOS or enable `DisableIoMapper` if it is not an option (this broke audio for me)
- Patch conflicting IRQ in your ACPI by using [SSDTTime](https://github.com/corpnewt/SSDTTime). If you have conflicts in IRQ, peripherals such as audio may not work.

## Comments
- The NVMe SSD in this system does not get recognised as being internal. There is a DeviceProperties entry that sets this property to true.
